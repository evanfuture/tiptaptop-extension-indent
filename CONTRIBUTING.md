Because this project is developed within a private monorepo, the typescript config will likely break if you try to run in yourself. It _should_ be enough to just remove the 3 tsconfig files when working locally, or modify the tsconfig.json, but please don't commit those changes when making a Pull Request.

Other than that, contributions are welcome!
